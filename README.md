# Sweet Events App
This is an app created by Jeremy Smith and Evan Bonertz to market events and sell tickets. 
It is a simple and mobile responsive design with a scrolling feed of images and details similar to Instagram.

##Tech
This was our first project using the Angular.js framework to build the different Views and Controllers and inject partials into the app.
We used JSON files to store data about the events and AJAX calls to get the from the JSON.
